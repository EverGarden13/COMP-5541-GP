# LLM Evaluation Analysis - Summary Report

## What Was Accomplished

‚úÖ **Complete Analysis of 180 LLM Responses**
- Analyzed all responses from 3 models (GPT-4.1-mini, Llama, Mistral)
- Covered 2 categories (Coding and Paraphrasing) with 30 prompts each
- **No missing responses** - all 180 responses were successfully analyzed

‚úÖ **Automated Score Calculation**
- Calculated individual metric scores for each response
- Applied weighted scoring based on predefined importance
- Generated comprehensive statistical analysis

‚úÖ **Updated Excel File with Calculated Scores**
- Original `records.xlsx` now updated with all calculated scores
- All empty Score and Mean_Score columns now populated
- Individual metric scores (Metric_A through Metric_D) calculated
