# LLM Evaluation Analysis Methodology

## Overview

This document explains the comprehensive methodology used to analyze and score the responses from three Large Language Models (GPT-4.1-mini, Llama, and Mistral) across two evaluation categories: **Coding** and **Paraphrasing, Generation, and Creation**.

## 1. Analysis Framework

### 1.1 Evaluation Structure
- **Models Evaluated**: 3 (GPT-4.1-mini, Llama, Mistral)
- **Categories**: 2 (Coding, Paraphrasing)
- **Prompts per Category**: 30
- **Total Responses Expected**: 180 (3 models × 2 categories × 30 prompts)

### 1.2 Scoring System
- **Scale**: 0-10 points for each metric
- **Weighting**: Each metric has a predefined weight based on importance
- **Final Score**: Weighted average of all metrics within each category

## 2. Coding Category Analysis

### 2.1 Metrics and Weights

| Metric | Weight | Justification |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| **Correctness** | 40% | Most critical aspect - incorrect code is unusable |
| **Efficiency** | 20% | Important for performance and scalability |
| **Readability** | 20% | Essential for maintenance and collaboration |
| **Error Handling** | 20% | Crucial for robust, production-ready code |

### 2.2 Detailed Scoring Decision Process

#### 2.2.1 Correctness (40% weight) - Base Score: 5.0/10

**Decision Logic**: Correctness is the most critical aspect of code - if code doesn't work, nothing else matters.

**Positive Indicators** (+points):
```python
if 'def ' in response:
    correctness_score += 1.5  # Function definition present
if 'return' in response:
    correctness_score += 1.0  # Function returns value
if 'import' in response or 'from' in response:
    correctness_score += 0.5  # Shows dependency awareness
if 'class ' in response:
    correctness_score += 1.0  # Object-oriented approach
if any(keyword in response for keyword in ['if ', 'for ', 'while ', 'try:']):
    correctness_score += 0.5  # Control structures present
if '(' in response and ')' in response:
    correctness_score += 0.5  # Function calls/proper syntax
```

**Negative Indicators** (-points):
```python
if 'error' in response or 'exception' in response:
    if 'handle' not in response and 'try' not in response:
        correctness_score -= 1.0  # Error mentions without handling
```

**Rationale**: 
- Function definitions (`def`) are fundamental to most coding tasks
- Return statements indicate the function produces output
- Import statements show awareness of external dependencies
- Control structures indicate logical flow implementation
- Unhandled error mentions suggest problematic code

#### 2.2.2 Efficiency (20% weight) - Base Score: 5.0/10

**Decision Logic**: Efficiency matters for performance but isn't always critical for basic functionality.

**Positive Indicators** (+points):
```python
if any(term in response for term in ['o(n)', 'o(log', 'efficient', 'optimize', 'complexity']):
    efficiency_score += 2.0  # Algorithmic complexity awareness
if any(term in response for term in ['dict', 'set', 'hash', 'dictionary']):
    efficiency_score += 1.5  # Efficient data structures
if any(term in response for term in ['binary search', 'sort', 'heap']):
    efficiency_score += 1.0  # Efficient algorithms
```

**Negative Indicators** (-points):
```python
if any(term in response for term in ['nested loop', 'o(n^2)', 'o(n²)', 'brute force']):
    efficiency_score -= 1.0  # Inefficient approaches
```

**Rationale**:
- Big O notation mentions show algorithmic thinking
- Efficient data structures (dict, set) are crucial for performance
- Specific algorithm mentions indicate optimization awareness
- Nested loops often indicate inefficient solutions

#### 2.2.3 Readability (20% weight) - Base Score: 5.0/10

**Decision Logic**: Readable code is maintainable code - essential for real-world development.

**Positive Indicators** (+points):
```python
if '"""' in response or "'''" in response:
    readability_score += 2.0  # Docstrings present
if '#' in response:
    readability_score += 1.5  # Comments present
if len(response) > 100:
    readability_score += 0.5  # Comprehensive solution
if len(descriptive_names) > 3:  # Variable names > 3 characters
    readability_score += 1.5  # Descriptive naming
if '    ' in response or '\t' in response:
    readability_score += 1.0  # Proper indentation
```

**Rationale**:
- Docstrings are Python best practice for documentation
- Comments explain complex logic
- Longer responses often indicate more complete solutions
- Descriptive variable names improve code understanding
- Proper indentation shows code structure awareness

#### 2.2.4 Error Handling (20% weight) - Base Score: 3.0/10

**Decision Logic**: Error handling is often overlooked but crucial for robust applications. Lower base score reflects this common weakness.

**Positive Indicators** (+points):
```python
if 'try:' in response and 'except' in response:
    error_handling_score += 4.0  # Full try-except block
elif 'try:' in response or 'except' in response:
    error_handling_score += 2.0  # Partial error handling
if 'raise' in response:
    error_handling_score += 2.0  # Custom exception raising
if any(term in response for term in ['valueerror', 'typeerror', 'filenotfounderror', 'keyerror']):
    error_handling_score += 1.5  # Specific exception types
if any(term in response for term in ['if not', 'assert', 'validate']):
    error_handling_score += 1.0  # Input validation
```

**Rationale**:
- Complete try-except blocks show proper error handling
- Specific exception types indicate targeted error management
- Input validation prevents errors before they occur
- Custom exceptions show advanced error handling

## 3. Paraphrasing Category Analysis

### 3.1 Metrics and Weights

| Metric | Weight | Justification |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| **Relevance & Fidelity** | 30% | Core requirement - output must be relevant and accurate |
| **Creativity & Originality** | 30% | Key differentiator for generative tasks |
| **Fluency & Coherence** | 20% | Foundation for usable text output |
| **Prompt Adherence** | 20% | Critical for following specific instructions |

### 3.2 Detailed Scoring Decision Process

#### 3.2.1 Relevance & Fidelity (30% weight) - Base Score: 5.0/10

**Decision Logic**: The primary purpose of paraphrasing is maintaining meaning while changing form.

**Positive Indicators** (+points):
```python
if 10 <= word_count <= 200:
    relevance_score += 2.5  # Appropriate length
elif 200 < word_count <= 300:
    relevance_score += 1.5  # Comprehensive but verbose
elif word_count > 300:
    relevance_score += 0.5  # Very comprehensive
if any(term in response.lower() for term in ['explain', 'describe', 'meaning', 'refers to']):
    relevance_score += 1.0  # Explanatory content
```

**Negative Indicators** (-points):
```python
if word_count < 10:
    relevance_score -= 2.0  # Too brief
if quote_count > 6:  # Too many quotes
    relevance_score -= 1.0  # Over-reliance on source
```

**Rationale**:
- Appropriate length indicates balanced coverage
- Explanatory terms show understanding of the task
- Too many quotes suggest copying rather than paraphrasing
- Very short responses often miss key information

#### 3.2.2 Creativity & Originality (30% weight) - Base Score: 5.0/10

**Decision Logic**: Creative tasks require going beyond simple reformulation.

**Positive Indicators** (+points):
```python
if any(term in response.lower() for term in ['imagine', 'creative', 'unique', 'innovative']):
    creativity_score += 2.0  # Creative language
if vocab_diversity > 0.8:  # Unique words / total words
    creativity_score += 2.0  # High vocabulary diversity
elif vocab_diversity > 0.6:
    creativity_score += 1.0  # Moderate diversity
if any(term in response.lower() for term in ['haiku', 'poem', 'story', 'once upon', 'metaphor']):
    creativity_score += 2.5  # Creative formats
if any(char in response for char in ['!', '?', '...', '—', '–']):
    creativity_score += 0.5  # Expressive punctuation
```

**Rationale**:
- Vocabulary diversity indicates linguistic creativity
- Creative formats show format adaptation skills
- Expressive punctuation adds emotional depth
- Creative language terms indicate innovative thinking

#### 3.2.3 Fluency & Coherence (20% weight) - Base Score: 6.0/10

**Decision Logic**: Fluency is foundational - higher base score reflects this expectation.

**Positive Indicators** (+points):
```python
if sentence_count >= 3:
    fluency_score += 2.0  # Multiple sentences
elif sentence_count >= 2:
    fluency_score += 1.0  # Basic sentence structure
if any(term in response.lower() for term in ['however', 'therefore', 'furthermore', 'moreover', 'additionally', 'consequently']):
    fluency_score += 1.5  # Coherence markers
if response.count(',') > 0:
    fluency_score += 0.5  # Comma usage
```

**Negative Indicators** (-points):
```python
if word_count < 5:
    fluency_score -= 3.0  # Very short
elif word_count < 10:
    fluency_score -= 1.0  # Short
```

**Rationale**:
- Multiple sentences indicate structured thinking
- Coherence markers show logical flow
- Proper punctuation indicates grammatical awareness
- Very short responses often lack coherence

#### 3.2.4 Prompt Adherence (20% weight) - Base Score: 5.0/10

**Decision Logic**: Following instructions is crucial but requires prompt-specific analysis.

**Prompt-Specific Scoring**:
```python
# Email format prompts (P08, P17)
if prompt_num in [8, 17]:
    if '@' in response or any(term in response.lower() for term in ['dear', 'sincerely', 'regards', 'email']):
        adherence_score += 2.0  # Email elements
    if any(term in response for term in ['1.', '2.', '3.', '•', '-', '*']):
        adherence_score += 1.5  # List structures

# Length-constrained prompts (P03, P25)
if prompt_num in [3, 25]:
    if word_count <= 50:
        adherence_score += 2.5  # Constraint following

# Recipe to poem prompt (P23)
if prompt_num == 23:
    if any(term in response.lower() for term in ['rhyme', 'verse', 'poem']):
        adherence_score += 2.0  # Format adherence
```

**General Indicators**:
```python
if any(term in response.lower() for term in ['formal', 'casual', 'professional', 'friendly']):
    adherence_score += 1.0  # Tone awareness
```

**Rationale**:
- Different prompts require different response formats
- Specific format elements indicate instruction following
- Tone awareness shows attention to prompt requirements
- Length constraints test ability to follow specific limits

## 4. Scoring Calculation Process

### 4.1 General Scoring Philosophy

#### Core Principles
1. **Base Score Approach**: Each metric starts with a reasonable base score (typically 3-6/10)
2. **Incremental Scoring**: Points are added or subtracted based on specific indicators
3. **Bounded Results**: All scores are capped between 0.0 and 10.0
4. **Heuristic Analysis**: Automated analysis of text patterns and keywords
5. **Consistent Application**: Same rules applied to all models and responses

#### Why This Approach?
- **Objectivity**: Reduces human bias through consistent automated scoring
- **Transparency**: Clear rules that can be audited and modified
- **Scalability**: Can process large datasets efficiently
- **Reproducibility**: Same input always produces same output

### 4.2 Step-by-Step Process

1. **Initialize Base Score**: Each metric starts with its predetermined base score
2. **Apply Positive Indicators**: Add points for detected positive features
3. **Apply Negative Indicators**: Subtract points for detected negative features
4. **Bound the Result**: Ensure final score is between 0.0 and 10.0
5. **Calculate Weighted Score**: Multiply by metric weight and sum for final score

### 4.3 Example Calculation

For a coding response:
```python
# Base scores
correctness = 5.0
efficiency = 5.0
readability = 5.0
error_handling = 3.0

# After applying indicators
correctness = 8.5  # Found def, return, imports
efficiency = 6.5   # Found dict usage
readability = 9.0  # Found docstrings, comments
error_handling = 7.0  # Found try-except

# Weighted calculation
final_score = (8.5 * 0.4) + (6.5 * 0.2) + (9.0 * 0.2) + (7.0 * 0.2)
final_score = 3.4 + 1.3 + 1.8 + 1.4 = 7.9/10
```
